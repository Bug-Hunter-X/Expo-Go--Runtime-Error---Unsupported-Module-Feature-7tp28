# Expo Go Runtime Error: Unsupported Module/Feature

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when developing Expo applications and using Expo Go for testing.  The core problem is that Expo Go, while excellent for rapid prototyping, has limitations regarding the access to native device capabilities and certain modules.

## The Problem

Attempting to utilize modules or features not supported within the Expo Go runtime environment will lead to errors. These errors typically manifest during app execution and often lack detailed error messages. The specific module causing the error will vary from case to case. 

## Troubleshooting and Solution

The primary solution is to identify and address the unsupported module.  Consider the following:

* **Review the Expo Go documentation:** The official documentation specifies the limitations of Expo Go.
* **Replace with Expo alternatives:** Check whether Expo provides alternative modules or approaches to achieve the desired functionality without relying on unsupported native modules.
* **Build a standalone app:** For testing functionality that requires direct hardware access, build and run a standalone version of your application.
