This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module in Expo Go that is not supported by the Expo Go runtime environment. Expo Go has limitations compared to a fully built standalone app.  For instance, some native modules or features requiring direct access to device hardware might not work within Expo Go.  The specific error message can be more informative, indicating which module or functionality is problematic.  Code examples are not directly relevant as the error lies in the environment, not the code itself.
