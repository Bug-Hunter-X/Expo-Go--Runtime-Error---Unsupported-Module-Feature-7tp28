The solution focuses on identifying the unsupported feature and either switching to a compatible solution or building a standalone app.

For instance, if the error is related to a native module, review the Expo documentation to see if an alternative exists.  If not, the best course of action is to test and debug your application using a standalone build instead of Expo Go.

Here's a code example (albeit not showing the exact error, as it depends on the module used):

// Assume the problematic code is attempting to use a camera module that doesn't fully work in Expo Go

//bug.js
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera'; // Might fail in Expo Go

async function takePhoto(){//Function that fails in Expo Go}

//solution.js
//Either replace with an alternative that works in Expo Go, or build a standalone application to test this.
